WHERE I LEFT OFF - frontend

Left off
  - Sending firstName to frontend on url. Look into string methods to grab firstName so it can be used on frontend. Look for index of last "/" and slice after that to the end???
  - Display firstName with a `Welcome ${firstName}` on home page if the user is signed in and display "Welcome" when they are not.  

TODO

- Ensure email has @ in the email??? Better way to ensure the email is an actual email???

- When user initially goes to site, they can browse movies but if they click on Add to Watchlist, prompt them to login or create an account.

- Have account page where you can update your email and change your password??? Other misc account things???
